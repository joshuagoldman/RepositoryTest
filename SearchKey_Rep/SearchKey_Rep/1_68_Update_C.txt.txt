This document shall be used to give inputs for decision forum regarding criteria file to Claims/Repair HW-log LPA 108 338.

 
1	Basic information
1.1	Responsible for this proposal
Stéfan Bertolotti – UABBETI	(Digital RRAG G2)
1.2	Revision information

Rev	Date	Major changes
A	20180914	Approved in LAT meeting 2018-09-02
B	2019-05-17	Changed applicable products - chap 2.1
Improved set of rules to identify faulty component – chap 2 and 3
Updated with SearchKeys
Reviewed in LAT meeting 2019-05-08
C	2019-06-19	- Added new applicable products - chap 2.1
- Added new criteria for Rule 1 (rule 1f to 1k), based on product number. See sub-sections of chap 2.4.3.1
- Following changes made in Rule 1 compared to Rev B: new code 0x11, and code 0x9 moved from rule 1c to rule 1b (see Table 1-A)
1.3	Why do we need this criteria?
The purpose of this LAT rule is to identify the units that have showed signs of the specific problem and recommend a correct repair action.
Around 300 BB units with PLL fault symptoms have been identified in PQAT.
Fault slip through has been observed in standard repair test.
1.4	Need for RIR / RCO
-	Buffer stock is impacted (to secure not run dry)	 NO
-	Component shall be claimed against vendor	 NO
-	Component changes need complex instructions	 NO
-	Component changes where predicted impact 
deviates much from predicted component MTBF    NO
-	Shall the revision of the unit be changed to 
obtain traceability.                                                    NO

2.4	Criteria Definition
First step for the LAT is to search for a number of entries in different logs.
Entries should be stored as the rules are defined based on a combination of the different entries.

 
2.4.1	Step 1: Collect Trap info in logs
Criteria 1: Trace from HW Log (ee_esi file)
Look for line in the log with (A6P) entry and read out the Value parameter on the same line (Trap info):
(A6P)  ICM CCR PLL(s) LOSS-OF-LOCK event has occured. Value 0xffd/0x2
 where the Trap info, 0x2 in the example above (located after the ‘/’ character), should be recorded.

Attached HW Log including the wanted trace:
 

Criteria 2: Trace from system log
Locate the syslog.txt file that is stored in the following folder:
...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\esi.XXX.tar.gz\esi.XXX.tar\var\log\
Note: LAT tool team needs to check for possible other locations of this file.
(...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\var\log etc.)

Look for line in the log with ‘ICM CCR PLL’ entry and read out the Value parameter on the same line (Trap info):
ICM CCR PLL(s) LOSS-OF-LOCK event has occured. Value 0xd19/0xd19
 where the Trap info, 0xd19 in the example above (located after the ‘/’ character), should be recorded.
Extract from syslog with the wanted trace:
2019-01-16T15:34:39.504631+00:00 axm56xx rhsd[3647]: EXTIF: tdmp registered
2019-01-16T15:34:39.513374+00:00 axm56xx rhsd[3647]: HWLOG: <A6P><ICM CCR PLL(s) LOSS-OF-LOCK event has occured. Value 0x1fe/0x1 (0)>:0x0
2019-01-16T15:34:39.533232+00:00 axm56xx rhsd[3647]: EXTIF: eatcc registered

Criteria 3: Trace from uboot log
1.	Locate the uboot.txt file that is stored in the following folder:
...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\CMD\
Note: LAT tool team needs to check for possible other locations of this file (...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\, ...\Node0\ etc.).

2.	Look for the following info in the uboot log:
CCR_PLL_LOCKED:0xf7b trap:0x4
where the trap info, 0x4 in the example above, should be recorded.
Attached uboot.txt file including the wanted trace:
 

2.4.2	Step 2: Collect other PLL traces
Criteria 1: Trace from HW Log (ee_esi file)
Record presence of the following entries in the HW Log, marked in red.
(A6M)  SyntB PLL
(A6M)  SyntB fPLL
(A6M)  SyntC PLL
(A6M)  SyntC fPLL
(A6M)  Multiplier PLL
(A6N)  Loss of toggle detection

Note the syntax with 2x ‘blank‘.
Attached a HW Log including most of the wanted trace:
 

Criteria 2: Trace from system log
Locate the syslog.txt file that is stored in the following folder:
...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\esi.XXX.tar.gz\esi.XXX.tar\var\log\
Note: LAT tool team needs to check for possible other locations of this file.
(...\Node0\LOG_1_XXX_LogsAndDumps\var\log etc.)

Record presence of the following entries in the Syslog Log, marked in red.
<A6M><SynthB PLL
<A6M><SynthB fPLL
<A6M><SynthC PLL
<A6M><SynthC fPLL
<A6M><Multiplier PLL
<A6N><Loss of toggle detection

Extract from syslog with some the wanted trace: (from complaintID EMEA:8008402399:2012519726:9)

1k	0x3	D2000

Additional condition:
IF (Rule 1i) AND (Rule 1j) trigger at the same time, then the output should be POS = D2000

 
2.4.3.2	Rule 2: Valid when no ‘Trap info’ available from Step 1
Apply following conditions based on combinations of entries.
Suggested SearchKeys:

2.5	Criteria Valid for

LOG test	Screening Test	Proactive Fault finding
Y	Y	N
2.6	SC/RC Location limitations for criteria
3	Output from the Claims/Repair HW-log LPA 108 338
3.1	Info text in PRTT/Screening center
“Send unit to Repair Center”
3.2	Information text to repair center
Generic output:
“HW Fault indicated.
Replace component at position POS
Report as A105/59. Major Fault.”
Where the position POS is specified by the rules in chapters 2.4.3.

Note for implementation team:
In case several component positions POS are pointed out by the logic, the LAT output should be one line per action, like:
“HW Fault indicated 
Replace component at position POS
Replace component at position POS
Report as A105/59. Major Fault.”

3.3	Information text to lead repair centre (extended information)
See previous chapter.
